## I cleaned and transformed a real-time COVID dataset using SQL queries and visualized the results on a Power BI dashboard.


The following project is based on COVID-19:

The Study Focuses on :
1. Total_cases vs Total Deaths.
2. Total_cases vs Population.
3. Countries with the highest infection rate compared to the population.
4. Countries with the highest death count per population. 
5. Continent with the highest Death Counts.
6. GLOBAL Numbers
7. Total Population vs Vaccination
