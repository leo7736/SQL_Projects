# ACCENTURE VIRTUAL INTERNSHIP

Social Buzz, a fast-growing technology unicorn, receives over 100,000 posts per day and 36,500,000 pieces of content per year. The company wants to understand customer engagement and leverage its rapid growth. 

To achieve this, I analyzed their content categories and identified the top 5 categories with the highest aggregate popularity. Using Microsoft SQL Server, I extracted, cleaned, and merged necessary columns from different datasets. Then, I created a compelling visualization and PowerPoint presentation to meet the project requirements. 



I utilized tools such as Microsoft SQL Server, PowerPoint, and Excel.
